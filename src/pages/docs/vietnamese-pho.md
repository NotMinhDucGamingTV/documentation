However, here's the pho recipe:

Ingredients
--------------------------------------------------------------

For the Broth:
2 lbs beef bones (or chicken bones if making chicken pho)
1 large onion, halved
1 large ginger root, sliced
4-5 star anise pods
1 cinnamon stick
4-5 whole cloves
1 tablespoon coriander seeds
Fish sauce (to taste, about 1/4 cup)
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
6-7 quarts water

For the Soup:
1 lb beef brisket or chicken breast (optional, if you want meat in your pho)
1 lb rice noodles (pho noodles)
Fresh herbs: cilantro, basil, mint
Bean sprouts
Lime wedges
Green onions, chopped
Sliced chili peppers (optional)
Hoisin sauce and Sriracha (for serving)

Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Step 1: Prepare the Bones and Meat
Blanch the bones: Place beef (or chicken) bones in a large pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes to remove impurities. Drain the water and rinse the bones under cold water.
Char the aromatics: Place the onion and ginger directly on a flame or under the broiler, turning frequently, until they are charred. This adds a smoky flavor to the broth.

### Step 2: Make the Broth
In a large stockpot, add the blanched bones, charred onion, ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and coriander seeds.
Add water: Pour in about 6-7 quarts of water to cover everything.
Simmer: Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Skim any scum that rises to the top.
Season the broth: Add fish sauce, salt, and sugar. Let the broth simmer for 3-4 hours (for beef) or 1.5-2 hours (for chicken), skimming occasionally and adjusting seasoning as necessary.
Optional: Add meat: About 1 hour before the broth is done, you can add brisket or chicken breast to the broth to cook. Once the meat is cooked, remove it, slice it thinly, and set it aside.

### Step 3: Prepare the Noodles and Garnishes
Cook the rice noodles: Follow the package instructions. Typically, you'll need to soak them in hot water for 10-15 minutes, then drain.
Prepare garnishes: Wash and chop herbs, lime wedges, and slice green onions and chili peppers. Arrange them on a plate with bean sprouts.

### Step 4: Assemble the Pho
Strain the broth: After simmering, strain the broth to remove the bones and spices. Taste and adjust the seasoning with fish sauce or salt as needed.
Assemble the bowls: Place a serving of cooked noodles into each bowl. Add slices of the cooked meat (if using) or thinly sliced raw beef (the hot broth will cook it).
Ladle the broth: Pour the hot broth over the noodles and meat.
Garnish: Top with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime juice, green onions, and chili slices. Add hoisin sauce or Sriracha if desired.

### Step 5: Serve
Enjoy your homemade pho with the optional sauces on the side, and adjust the flavors with lime juice, chili, and herbs as you like!
